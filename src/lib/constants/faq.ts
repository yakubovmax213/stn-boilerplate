    description:
      'PawsitiveAI is a AI assistant based on the OpenAI large-scale language model. It is based on the principle of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), a deep neural network specifically designed for speech processing. GPT model is trained to naturally understand and respond to human speech. It can be used in various applications, such as chat-bots, customer service systems, or virtual assistants, to facilitate human-machine interaction.',

    description:
      'AI is fine-tuned from GPT-3.5, a language model trained to produce text. ChatGPT was optimized for dialogue by using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) – a method that uses human demonstrations and preference comparisons to guide the model toward desired behavior.',

    description:
      "These models were trained on vast amounts of data from the internet written by humans, including conversations, so the responses it provides may sound human-like. It is important to keep in mind that this is a direct result of the system's design (i.e. maximizing the similarity between outputs and the dataset the models were trained on) and that such outputs may be inaccurate, untruthful, and otherwise misleading at times.",

      AI is not connected to the internet, and it can occasionally produce incorrect answers. It has limited knowledge of world and events after 2021 and may also occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content.
      We'd recommend checking whether responses from the model are accurate or not. If you find an answer is incorrect, please provide that feedback by using the "Thumbs Down" button.`,
